# About

These are My solutions to this years AoC puzzles. This is my first time doing this, so the code is generally super bad and not worth even looking at.
Also, the point of doing all of this is for me to learn how to use my chosen IDE and Git in addition to just honing my knowledge of Java - my chosen language.
